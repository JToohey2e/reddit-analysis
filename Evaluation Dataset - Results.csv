Although it very rarely takes this exact form, this is not that uncommon in the slightly perverse way that American political campaigns work.  Campaigns regularly run up significant unpaid debts in the last few weeks of the campaign.  This is because political campaign organizations are legally able to continue to fundraise even after the election to retire campaign debts.  So it is actually really common for a winning candidate to then have a post-election fundraiser to pay off campaign debts.  Of course, if someone won, that means you're paying to get to hobnob with an elected official now.  On the other hand, if you lose it's much harder to raise that money.  So this is a pretty classic hail mary. Those unpaid wages are campaign debts and if she wins her workers will likely get paid, just late. If she loses they probably won't get paid.  Except, typically it's not campaign workers, because that creates some legal issues as well as the problem of the workers walking away in the last few days of the campaign.  Usually it's things like an unpaid Bill to the sign manufacturing shop or unpaid Bill to the newspaper or consultant fees or something else. Since citizens united TV companies have typically demanded 100% payment up front to book a TV advertising.",0.078,American

Although it very rarely takes this exact form, this is not that uncommon in the slightly perverse way that American political campaigns work.  Campaigns regularly run up significant unpaid debts in the last few weeks of the campaign.  This is because political campaign organizations are legally able to continue to fundraise even after the election to retire campaign debts.  So it is actually really common for a winning candidate to then have a post-election fundraiser to pay off campaign debts.  Of course, if someone won, that means you're paying to get to hobnob with an elected official now.  On the other hand, if you lose it's much harder to raise that money.  So this is a pretty classic hail mary. Those unpaid wages are campaign debts and if she wins her workers will likely get paid, just late. If she loses they probably won't get paid.  Except, typically it's not campaign workers, because that creates some legal issues as well as the problem of the workers walking away in the last few days of the campaign.  Usually it's things like an unpaid Bill to the sign manufacturing shop or unpaid Bill to the newspaper or consultant fees or something else. Since citizens united TV companies have typically demanded 100% payment up front to book a TV advertising.",0.078,Bill

books,ypeelr,203,"My daughter used to love this book called ""Ballet Bunny"" about a little bunny girl from the countryside who found a ballet class in the city and desperately wanted to join. She did, and she ended up being so good that the teacher gave her a starring role in the big recital. She was so excited that her whole family came to watch her, and she danced gloriously. Everyone loved her! But afterward, her family hopped off and abandoned her. The next day, they all told her that she probably didn't want to play with them now since she was such a great ballerina, so they basically ignored her and abandoned her again. She decided not to be a ballerina anymore, threw away her ballet shoes, and then the family accepted her again and she was happy. The end.  It's fine until the recital, then it takes a turn. The message seems to be that you have to give up your dreams and/or stop doing things you're really good at (and love) so that you family will accept you on their terms. I hate it.

Bookseller here 📖 I agree with you mostly, we just have to be careful with what YA actually means - YA (Young Adult) usually means coming of Age stories, the characters being in highschool usually and finding out who they are - Love, Simon, for example. What you are talking about is probably NA (New Adult), those are usually Colleen Hoovers works, Ali Hazelwood, stuff like that. Those have turned into one big puddle of the same thing, I agree. The sad thing is, that many bookstores muddle YA and NA together, don’t know the difference or just choose to ignore it and label NA YA when it’s really not. Also, Booktok is overrun by NA readers, dark mafia romance type stuff. Which, if you like it, i’m happy for you, enjoy your next read! If you don’t though, and are just on booktok to find recommendations, it’s easy to be advertised books as something they aren’t. So, what i’m saying is this: It’s hard to find the right book by just following the popular trends nowadays. Many bookstores have to have the bestsellers, Top reads and new arrivals. If you don’t like those, feel free to dig deeper! ask people working there if there’s someone who’s an expert on the genre you want to read - believe me, we’re always happy to help, especially with our favorite genre we get really excited, and please please say No when you don’t like one book. We’ll keep digging and find something you like. If you don’t want to ask people working there for help (understandably, it’s scary sometimes haha), take the time to visit goodreads online, that usually helps me. Look up current trends, read the reviews (i usually read the negative ones first, they’re more honest and less blinded) and then pick out what you like!

When I was a teen I would just go to the library’s YA section and browse for whatever seemed to interest me and found plenty of books that weren’t shitty fantasy smut read and I still do the same now as an adult when I’m in the mood to read something light. I’ll go the YA section of my library and just see what catches my eye and I’ve managed to find plenty of good, recently published YA that has nothing to do with romance or smut. Some favourite YA authors I’ve found have been Elizabeth Acevedo and Alice Oseman.  Also Ali Hazelwood isn’t YA but writes firmly in the adult romance genre which… ya’know is gonna be primarily focused on romance and smut. Idk why you think an adult romance could be YA but I would probably stop following anyone who suggests such and stop following booktok recs.",0.129,Alice Oseman

And the ""man"" is pretty invincible. He also releases the army of the dead by considering their oath fulfilled, and the are immediately freed from this no life of pain.  It extends to early ages, with the ""treason"" of Feänor or even Melkor, whose powers ""shrinked"" (the same thing happened to Mairon/Sauron) gradually as he was doing more and more things going against Eru's vision or the Valar's will.  It is explained that being evil or using powers going against nature consumes them. But the process is linked to them again parting from a scheme and breaking an oath, spoken or not.
