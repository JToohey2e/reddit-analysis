60,"Separate out of the politics of this.

Although it very rarely takes this exact form, this is not that uncommon in the slightly perverse way that American political campaigns work.

Campaigns regularly run up significant unpaid debts in the last few weeks of the campaign.

This is because political campaign organizations are legally able to continue to fundraise even after the election to retire campaign debts.

So it is actually really common for a winning candidate to then have a post-election fundraiser to pay off campaign debts.

Of course, if someone won, that means you're paying to get to hobnob with an elected official now.

On the other hand, if you lose it's much harder to raise that money.

So this is a pretty classic hail mary. Those unpaid wages are campaign debts and if she wins her workers will likely get paid, just late. If she loses they probably won't get paid.

Except, typically it's not campaign workers, because that creates some legal issues as well as the problem of the workers walking away in the last few days of the campaign.

Usually it's things like an unpaid Bill to the sign manufacturing shop or unpaid Bill to the newspaper or consultant fees or something else. Since citizens united TV companies have typically demanded 100% payment up front to book a TV advertising.",politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yplacx/republican_candidate_admitting_shes_not_paid_team/,2cneq,yplacx

This is one of the reasons why the league was walking on egg shells. Kyrie is a member of the NBPA and has a lot of respect. I’d imagine a lot of players aren’t feeling how the Nets are punishing him and that list of demands that were handed to him

It’s a bad look on us if we didn’t punish him for antisemitism. It’s a bad look on how harsh the punishment is cause now the NBPA steps in and it’s about to be them vs Brooklyn while Kyrie still here. We can’t win smh

What was Joe Tsai supposed to do here? Somebody needs to ask Jaylen and whoever else.. what were the nets suppose to do? Suspend Kyrie for only 2 games? They would complain about that too. Antisemitism is serious Tsai and ownership had to be serious with this which is why the list, excessive as it might appear, was needed. They need to know that Kyrie won’t just take a few games suspension and come back saying the same foolishness. It’s not so much on NBPA. it’s the job of the union to protect their people I guess, but Jaylens side comments is probably how he personally feels too.

She did, and she ended up being so good that the teacher gave her a starring role in the big recital. She was so excited that her whole family came to watch her, and she danced gloriously. Everyone loved her! But afterward, her family hopped off and abandoned her. The next day, they all told her that she probably didn't want to play with them now since she was such a great ballerina, so they basically ignored her and abandoned her again. She decided not to be a ballerina anymore, threw away her ballet shoes, and then the family accepted her again and she was happy. The end.

It's fine until the recital, then it takes a turn. The message seems to be that you have to give up your dreams and/or stop doing things you're really good at (and love) so that you family will accept you on their terms. I hate it.

In the year 2098, there is no more war, no more hunger and no more pollution. The world is secure and Earth’s 2.9 billion people are healthy and happy. There is also only one remaining library that still houses physical books. In addition to the dusty volumes, the library holds many secrets. But the government has decided to shut it down and burn the contents. Unless an unlikely trio can save the books, humanity will lose more than just what is printed on those antique pages.

With a single government ruling the entire planet, one currency, one language and no religion, the population is unified and enjoying the prosperity that comes with more than seven decades of peace. Free healthcare for all and guaranteed employment make the future a dream. But this future may only be safe if they can hide the past. The books must be saved . . . the impossible task is up to an angry author, a brazen revolutionary and the last librarian.

Sounds like a great book, right? I was so excited to read it, but noooo. It just couldn't be good.

Massive, page long infodumps. New slang for words that didn't need to be replaced.

3/4ths of the book is spent building up a character, only for that character to be killed off screen. Literally one short throwaway sentence letting you know that character died.

Absolutely nothing is wrapped up in the book. Everything is left on a fucking cliffhanger.

The communication between the 3 main characters is fucking cringe inducing. Just about everything they say to each other comes in the form of quoting books. It freaking reads like a group of 3 pseudo-intellectual edgelords talking.

Then there's the major reveal 3/4ths of the way through that completely changes what the story is going to be about, which isn't hinted at at all throughout what you've already read.

231,"Perhaps the problem is where you're getting recommendations from. Booktok, for better or worse, has a stranglehold on what you are able to access and buy, because Booktok is currently the easiest way for booksellers and publishers to find out based on what young people, like you, are claiming to enjoy and like. And apparently, certain tropes have a massive appeal to most young people. Thus, publishers are pushing authors to write according to popular tropes to be able for them to market and sell the books well. Booksellers then end up with these ""tropes"". And those are the ones you see everywhere.

If you want to expand your reading, I would suggest checking out your library (if you have one) and talk to the librarians as to what they would recommend based on what intrigues or interests you. I actually prefer to get recommendations from actual people I can talk to.

Book tube, I think, is also a better place to get recommendations, depending on the creator.

232,"Hiya! Bookseller here 📖 I agree with you mostly, we just have to be careful with what YA actually means - YA (Young Adult) usually means coming of Age stories, the characters being in highschool usually and finding out who they are - Love, Simon, for example. What you are talking about is probably NA (New Adult), those are usually Colleen Hoovers works, Ali Hazelwood, stuff like that. Those have turned into one big puddle of the same thing, I agree. The sad thing is, that many bookstores muddle YA and NA together, don’t know the difference or just choose to ignore it and label NA YA when it’s really not. Also, Booktok is overrun by NA readers, dark mafia romance type stuff. Which, if you like it, i’m happy for you, enjoy your next read! If you don’t though, and are just on booktok to find recommendations, it’s easy to be advertised books as something they aren’t. So, what i’m saying is this: It’s hard to find the right book by just following the popular trends nowadays. Many bookstores have to have the bestsellers, Top reads and new arrivals. If you don’t like those, feel free to dig deeper! ask people working there if there’s someone who’s an expert on the genre you want to read - believe me, we’re always happy to help, especially with our favorite genre we get really excited, and please please say No when you don’t like one book. We’ll keep digging and find something you like. If you don’t want to ask people working there for help (understandably, it’s scary sometimes haha), take the time to visit goodreads online, that usually helps me. Look up current trends, read the reviews (i usually read the negative ones first, they’re more honest and less blinded) and then pick out what you like! I hope i could help, and i hope you find your next amazing read soon! ☺️

There is nothing wrong with sexy books for a female readership, it’s been judged harshly for decades. It’s clearly not for you (and was never for me either.) Sadly publishing markets to trends more than ever, and if you’re not in lockstep with what’s trendy you’re not going to enjoy the current offerings.

I’d try not to get hung up on genre and search out books that speak to you. YA wasn’t even a category when I was a teenager and we still found our books. What sort of stories are you interested in? For modern poetry I’d recommend Dearly by Margaret Atwood. If you want a great fantasy, Diana Wynne Jones edges into younger YA.

236,"I think another thing that might be relevant to the smut part of the discussion is that multiple authors have over the last years spoken out about getting marketed/shelved as YA, even though they write adult fiction. Interestingly this happened a lot with female or non-white authors who write books with diverse casts that for some reason seem to end up on YA shelves instead of general SFF even if the protagonist is a 40 year old man. Even Sarah K Maas series like ACOTAR are ""new adult"" according to her, for the readerbase 18-25 or sth similar, which is why they contain smut, but both my local library and bookstore shelve it right next to the Percy Jackson and skullduggery pleasant books.

Also as a 27yo who still reads the occassional ya book if it sounds interesting (also i like to know what im gifting to my teenage nieces), there absolutely are great ya books out there if you don't only look at this weeks tiktok trends.

It extends to early ages, with the ""treason"" of Feänor or even Melkor, whose powers ""shrinked"" (the same thing happened to Mairon/Sauron) gradually as he was doing more and more things going against Eru's vision or the Valar's will.

It is explained that being evil or using powers going against nature consumes them. But the process is linked to them again parting from a scheme and breaking an oath, spoken or not.

In each of these books, the male protagonist is extremely passive and relies upon strange forceful women to urge him into doing anything. In the latter 2, their wives leave them and the circumstances are vague and strange as well. I do wonder how much might be lost in translation, but also Murakami seems to create situations where the protagonist has a very, very awkward thought process around extreme sexual situations: sisters and puberty, r*pe facilitated through dreams, young girls talking about their own breasts in an unrealistic fashion. It’s not quite formulaic but he definitely has strong central themes he returns to in most of his works, from what I can tell so far. I find that some of the magical elements can get pretty cheesy at times, too, but I particularly loved Killing Commendatore when remembering how it was a deliberate homage to The Great Gatsby. I think he’s worth reading, because these tales are obviously very imaginative and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle feels ‘epic’ for the span of time it covers. He may rely too much upon his own invented tropes, which is why I’m spacing out getting into some of his other works on my list.
